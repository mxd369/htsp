Computing

A program consumes input and produces output. The inputs and outputs a program consumes and produces are called data.

A simple addition program consumes numbers and produces their sum.

In mathematics, the program, or function, is called an operator, and the inputs are called operands.

The group of an operator and its operands is called an expression. The output is called the value of the expression.

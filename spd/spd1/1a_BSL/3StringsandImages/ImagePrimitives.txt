Which primitive is required in the following expression to produce the stop sign image below?

(_______ (text "STOP" 48 "white") 

         (regular-polygon 60 8 "solid" "red"))

Overlay




Which image will the following expression produce?

(beside (square 20 "outline" "blue")
        (above (circle 15 "solid" "red")
               (triangle 20 "solid" "green")))

(beside (square 20 "outline" "blue")(above (circle 15 "solid" "red")(triangle 20 "solid" "green")))





Assume that the image below shows an entire program file. Why does running the program produce the following error?

(above (square 10 "solid" "red")
       (square 5 "solid" "blue"))

The program did not contain (require 2htpd/image) at the beginning




We have revised the program now, why are we still getting an error?
(require 2htpd/image)
(above (square 10 "solid" "red")
       (square 5 "solid" "blue"))

we misspelled the name of the required module, so we need to replace "2htpd" with "2htdp"

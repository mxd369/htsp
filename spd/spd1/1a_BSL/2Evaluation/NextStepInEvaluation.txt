What is the next step in the following evaluation?

Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))
Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3)) 

Step 2: __________________

(/ 12 (+ 3 3))


ANSWER
(/ 12 (+ 3 3))
EXPLANATION

The second operand to / is an expression, so it must be evaluated. And the first operand to + is an expression, so it must be evaluated. All of the operands to - are values, so - can be called with 7 and 4 as arguments. This replaces the - call expression with 3.

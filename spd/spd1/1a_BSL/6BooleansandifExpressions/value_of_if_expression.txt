What is the value of the if expresion below?

(if (> (string-length "hello") 10)
    "long"
	"short")

"short" <tt>"short"</tt> - correct
EXPLANATION

The question in the if expression is not a value, so we evaluate it and replace it with false. Since the question is false, we replace the entire if expression with the false-answer expression, which is just the value "short".

Let me stress something about this material.
I just can't make this point strongly enough.
This is the kind of material that you learn by doing.
I really want to encourage you, don't look at the problem
and then look at the solution.
If you do that, you're going to say to yourself, oh, I know how to do this.
You need to actually take the blank starter file
and work through the problem yourself from beginning to end.
That's the only way to learn this kind of material.
At any rate, have fun with the practice problems and the homework,
and I'll see you next week.
